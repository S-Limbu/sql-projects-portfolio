# SQL Projects Portfolio 💾
# 📊 SQL Business Analysis Portfolio

Welcome to my SQL Challenge Portfolio! This repository contains **25 carefully structured SQL exercises** designed to simulate **real-world business problems** across various departments such as Sales, Marketing, HR, Finance, and Product.

Each challenge focuses on not only writing correct SQL queries, but also understanding the **business context**, interpreting results, and communicating insights effectively.

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

To keep things clean, every challenge is documented across **three dedicated folders**:

### 🗂 `1-questions/`
This folder contains the **raw SQL problem-solving files**. Each file includes:
- A clearly defined business scenario
- Why the problem matters
- SQL table creation and sample data insertion
- The final SQL query used to solve the problem

### 🖼 `2-screenshots/`
Here you'll find screenshots of the SQL queries being executed along with the actual output. These act as **visual proof** of query correctness and database behavior.

### 📄 `3-analysis/`
Each `.md` file here includes:
- A business explanation of the problem
- A breakdown of the SQL logic used
- Reasoning for how the query solves the problem
- A summary of what the output tells us
- Why the insight matters for the business

These files serve as **analytical reflections** to show how I translate raw data into actionable insights — a skill critical in business intelligence, analytics, and decision-making.
