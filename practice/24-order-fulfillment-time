- 🧠 Problem / Business Scenario: You are a logistics analyst at an online retail company.
Your operations team wants to monitor how long it takes, on average, for orders to be fulfilled after they’re placed.
They’ve asked you to calculate the average fulfillment time in days between when an order was placed and when it was fulfilled.

- 📚 Concepts: DATE_DIFF + AVG

- 💡 Why this matters: 
  - Faster fulfillment leads to happier customers and fewer support complaints.
  - Enables comparisons across weeks, months, or different fulfillment centers.
  - Identifies trends or bottlenecks in shipping and warehouse processes.

-- 🔄 1. Drop existing table to avoid conflicts

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS users;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS purchases;

-- 🧱 2. Create the table schema

CREATE TABLE orders (
  order_id INT,
  order_date DATE,
  fulfill_date DATE
);

-- 📊 3. Insert sample/mock data

INSERT INTO orders VALUES
(1, '2024-01-01', '2024-01-03'),
(2, '2024-01-05', '2024-01-10'),
(3, '2024-01-10', '2024-01-15');

-- 🔍 4. Final query

SELECT 
AVG(fulfill_date - order_date) AS avg_fulfillment_days
FROM orders;
