## 🧠 Business Scenario
You're a Product Analyst at an e-commerce company. The Product Team wants to analyze how users progress through critical steps in the product journey:
Visiting the website -> Signing up -> Making a purchase
They need a quick snapshot of how many unique users complete each step in the funnel to identify drop-offs and conversion bottlenecks.

# 💡 Why This Insight Matters

- Helps detect where **users drop off** during onboarding or purchasing.

- Measures how well **marketing converts traffic** into signups and purchases.

- Informs **product improvements** and marketing ROI analysis.

# 🧰 SQL Concepts Used

| Concept               | Purpose                                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `COUNT(DISTINCT ...)` | Counts unique users at each funnel step                    |
| `GROUP BY`            | Groups results by funnel event (visit, signup, purchase)   |
| `ORDER BY`            | Sorts the output by number of users per event (descending) |

# 🧪 Query Logic Breakdown

```sql
SELECT event,
COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS users
FROM funnel
GROUP BY event
ORDER BY users DESC;


What’s happening and why?

- Data Modeling: Each row represents an individual event (visit, signup, or purchase) by a specific user_id.

- COUNT(DISTINCT user_id): Counts how many unique users performed each event type — ensuring duplicates are excluded.

- GROUP BY event: Aggregates the count at the event level (so we get one row per funnel stage).

- ORDER BY users DESC: Sorts the results to show the most completed steps first — usually visit, followed by signup, then purchase.

📊 Output Summary

| event    | users |
| -------- | ----- |
| visit    | 19    |
| signup   | 16    |
| purchase | 11    |


🔍 Business Insight
Out of 19 visitors:

84% (16/19) signed up

58% (11/19) went on to purchase

The most significant drop-off is between signup → purchase. This may indicate:

- Friction in the checkout process

- Pricing concerns

- Poor onboarding post-signup

🔑 Takeaway
This simple funnel report highlights conversion weak points and provides a baseline for improvement experiments, such as checkout flow changes or signup incentives.
