| `GROUP BY`     | Aggregates sales by region to compute total revenue per group.       |
| `SUM()`        | Calculates the total revenue (amount) for each region.               |
| `ORDER BY`     | Ranks regions from highest to lowest based on revenue contribution.  |

## 🧪 Query Logic Breakdown

```sql
SELECT region, SUM(amount) AS total_sales
FROM sales
GROUP BY region
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;

Step 1: GROUP BY region — This groups the sales data by each unique region so we can compute totals per region.

Step 2: SUM(amount) — Sums all the sales amounts for each region to calculate total revenue per group.

Step 3: ORDER BY total_sales DESC — Sorts the results from the highest to the lowest revenue to quickly identify top performers.

📊 Output Summary

| region | total\_sales |
| ------ | ------------ |
| North  | 1200         |
| South  | 950          |
| East   | 700          |
| West   | 433          |

- The North region leads in revenue with £1,200.

- The South follows closely, while the West significantly underperforms.

## 🔍 Business Insight
From this breakdown, we can conclude that North and South regions are strong contributors to overall revenue. These areas may benefit from additional marketing support to further capitalize on momentum. Conversely, the West region is underperforming, suggesting the need for a deeper review — perhaps issues with sales reps, local demand, or pricing strategies.

This type of region-specific breakdown is essential for making smart, targeted investment decisions rather than using a one-size-fits-all approach.

## ✅ Takeaway
Simple aggregation using GROUP BY and SUM() can uncover key regional trends that directly impact marketing budget decisions and long-term growth strategy.
