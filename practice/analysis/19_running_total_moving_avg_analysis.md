# ðŸ§° SQL Concepts Used

| Concept                             | Purpose                                            |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `SUM() OVER (ORDER BY ...)`         | Computes **running total** of revenue by day       |
| `AVG() OVER (...) ROWS BETWEEN ...` | Computes **3-day moving average** around each date |
| `ROUND()`                           | Rounds the average to 2 decimal places             |
| `WINDOW FRAME` (`ROWS BETWEEN ...`) | Controls the rolling window of data to average     |

# ðŸ§ª Query Logic Breakdown

```sql
SELECT 
  transaction_date,
  amount,
  SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY transaction_date) AS running_total,
  ROUND(
    AVG(amount) OVER (
      ORDER BY transaction_date
      ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
    ), 2
  ) AS moving_avg_3d
FROM transactions;


Whatâ€™s happening and why?

SUM(amount) OVER (ORDER BY transaction_date)
â†’ Creates a cumulative total of revenue across days, showing how much has been earned up to each date.

AVG(amount) OVER (...) ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
â†’ Calculates a 3-day moving average of revenue centered on the current row, including the current date and two days prior.
This smooths out short-term fluctuations and highlights underlying trends.

ROUND(..., 2)
â†’ Ensures the moving average is cleanly formatted for reporting (two decimal places).

ðŸ“Š Sample Output (simplified)

| transaction\_date | amount | running\_total | moving\_avg\_3d |
| ----------------- | ------ | -------------- | --------------- |
| 2024-01-01        | 100    | 100            | 100.00          |
| 2024-01-02        | 200    | 300            | 150.00          |
| 2024-01-03        | 150    | 450            | 150.00          |
| 2024-01-04        | 180    | 630            | 176.67          |
| 2024-01-05        | 300    | 930            | 210.00          |
| ...               | ...    | ...            | ...             |
