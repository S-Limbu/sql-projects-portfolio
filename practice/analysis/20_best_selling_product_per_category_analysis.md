# üß™ Query Logic Breakdown

```sql
WITH product_revenue AS (
  SELECT 
    p.category,
    p.name,
    SUM(s.quantity * s.price) AS revenue
  FROM sales s
  JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
  GROUP BY p.category, p.name
),
ranked AS (
  SELECT *,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY revenue DESC) AS rnk
  FROM product_revenue
)
SELECT 
  category,
  name AS best_product,
  revenue
FROM ranked
WHERE rnk = 1;


What‚Äôs happening and why?

product_revenue CTE
‚Üí Calculates total revenue (quantity √ó price) for each product grouped by category.
This shows how much each product earned in its category.

ranked CTE
‚Üí Assigns a ranking within each category based on descending revenue using RANK().
The product with rnk = 1 is the top-selling one for that category.

Final SELECT
‚Üí Filters to include only the top product per category, giving a clean, actionable list.

üìä Sample Output

| category    | best\_product | revenue |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Clothing    | Hoodie        | 1900    |
| Electronics | Laptop        | 2500    |
| Stationary  | Pens          | 480     |
| Food        | Chips         | 110     |

üîë Takeaway
This insight gives your team a razor-sharp view of:

What‚Äôs working (and should be pushed further)

What category leaders deserve more visibility or inventory

Where to direct category-specific marketing efforts

It‚Äôs the kind of analysis that supports data-driven merchandising, sales targeting, and inventory forecasting.
