| ------------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| `JOIN`                               | Combine sales and product info for full context |
| `GROUP BY` + `SUM(quantity * price)` | Aggregate revenue by product                    |
| `CTE (WITH)`                         | Structure logic into reusable building blocks   |

| `PARTITION BY`                       | Ensures ranking resets per category             |

# 🧪 Query Logic Breakdown

```sql
WITH product_revenue AS (
  SELECT 
    p.category,
    p.name,
    SUM(s.quantity * s.price) AS revenue
  FROM sales s
  JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.product_id
  GROUP BY p.category, p.name
),
ranked AS (
  SELECT *,
    RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY category ORDER BY revenue DESC) AS rnk
  FROM product_revenue
)
SELECT 
  category,
  name AS best_product,
  revenue
FROM ranked
WHERE rnk = 1;


What’s happening and why?

product_revenue CTE
→ Calculates total revenue (quantity × price) for each product grouped by category.
This shows how much each product earned in its category.

ranked CTE
→ Assigns a ranking within each category based on descending revenue using RANK().
The product with rnk = 1 is the top-selling one for that category.

Final SELECT
→ Filters to include only the top product per category, giving a clean, actionable list.

📊 Sample Output

| category    | best\_product | revenue |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------- |
| Clothing    | Hoodie        | 1900    |
| Electronics | Laptop        | 2500    |
| Stationary  | Pens          | 480     |
| Food        | Chips         | 110     |

🔑 Takeaway
This insight gives your team a razor-sharp view of:

What’s working (and should be pushed further)

What category leaders deserve more visibility or inventory

Where to direct category-specific marketing efforts

It’s the kind of analysis that supports data-driven merchandising, sales targeting, and inventory forecasting.
