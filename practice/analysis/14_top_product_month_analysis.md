## üß∞ SQL Concepts Used

| Concept                         | Purpose                                                               |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CTE (Common Table Expression)` | Structures the query in readable stages                               |
| `RANK()`                        | Assigns a rank to products based on quantity sold within each month   |

## üß™ Query Logic Breakdown

```sql
WITH monthly_sales AS (
  SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', sale_date) AS month, 
    product,
    SUM(quantity) AS total_quantity
  FROM sales
  GROUP BY month, product
),
ranked AS (
  SELECT *,
         RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY month ORDER BY total_quantity DESC) AS rnk
  FROM monthly_sales
)
SELECT * 
FROM ranked
WHERE rnk = 1;


What‚Äôs happening and why?

- First, we summarize monthly quantity sold per product (monthly_sales CTE).

- Next, we rank products by total quantity sold within each month (ranked CTE).

- Finally, we select only those ranked #1, i.e., top-selling products per month.

üìä Output Summary

| month      | product | total\_quantity | rnk |
| ---------- | ------- | --------------- | --- |
| 2023-01-01 | Phone   | 3               | 1   |
| 2023-02-01 | Tablet  | 9               | 1   |
| 2023-03-01 | Laptop  | 14              | 1   |

üîç Business Insight

January: Phone leads sales, but volume is relatively low.

February: Tablet dominates with the highest monthly total (9 units).

March: Laptop is clearly the top performer (14 units), suggesting rising demand or promotions.

This provides a clear snapshot of which product deserves priority in terms of stocking, marketing spend, and bundling.

üîë Takeaway
Laptops and Tablets are top-selling products in recent months ‚Äî ideal candidates for marketing focus and inventory scaling.
