## 🧪 Query Logic Breakdown

```sql
SELECT customer_id, 
       SUM(amount) AS lifetime_spend
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY lifetime_spend DESC;


What’s happening and why?

- The query groups all orders by customer_id.

- It then calculates the total spend (CLV) for each customer using SUM(amount).

- The results are sorted in descending order, highlighting top spenders first.

📊 Output Summary

| customer\_id | lifetime\_spend |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| 2            | 2100            |
| 1            | 1950            |
| 3            | 800             |
| 6            | 780             |
| 10           | 770             |
| 7            | 650             |
| 5            | 450             |
| 4            | 200             |
| 8            | 100             |
| 9            | 100             |

Both customer 8 and 9 have spent £100 total, though 1 customer could have made multiple purchases.

🔍 Business Insight

- The data reveals which customers contribute the most revenue over time.

- Even if two customers have spent the same total, one might be more engaged due to repeated purchases.

- This information enables tiered retention strategies — such as frequency-based promotions for recurring buyers or high-ticket rewards for one-time big spenders.

🔑 Takeaway
Customer Lifetime Value reveals your most valuable buyers — a vital metric for loyalty, retention, and personalized engagement campaigns.
