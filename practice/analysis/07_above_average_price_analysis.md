🧠 Business Scenario
The E-commerce Pricing Team wants to determine which products are priced above the average price of all items in the store. These premium-priced products can then be flagged for marketing strategies like bundling, exclusivity campaigns, or margin adjustments.

💡 Why This Insight Matters
Helps categorize products into pricing tiers like “budget,” “standard,” and “premium.”

Allows marketing to focus on high-margin items for bundles or featured promotions.

Enables pricing teams to make data-driven decisions when setting or reviewing price points.
