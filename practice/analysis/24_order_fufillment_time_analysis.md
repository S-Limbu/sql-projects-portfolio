# 🎯 Analysis: Average Fulfillment Time for Orders

---

## 🧠 Problem / Business Scenario
You’re a Logistics Analyst at an online retail company.
The Operations team wants to monitor how efficiently orders are being processed.
Specifically, they need to know how many days it takes, on average, for an order to be fulfilled once it’s been placed.

## 💡 Why This Matters

- Faster fulfillment = better customer experience (less support, more repeat business)

- Allows comparison across warehouses, time periods, or regions

- Can reveal bottlenecks or slowdowns in shipping or warehouse operations

## 🧰 SQL Concepts Used

| Concept                                    | Purpose                                            |
| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| `DATE_DIFF` or `fulfill_date - order_date` | Calculates the number of days between two dates    |
| `AVG()`                                    | Averages those fulfillment times across all orders |

---

## 🧪 Query Logic Breakdown

```sql
SELECT 
  AVG(fulfill_date - order_date) AS avg_fulfillment_days
FROM orders;


What’s happening and why?
fulfill_date - order_date computes the number of days taken per order.

AVG(...) calculates the mean time it takes to fulfill all orders in the dataset.

The result gives a single metric: average number of days between order placement and fulfillment.

📈 Business Insight
Let’s say the output is:

| avg\_fulfillment\_days |
| ---------------------- |
| 4.79                   |

🧠 This tells us:

On average, it takes about 4.8 days to fulfill an order.

If the goal is < 3 days, there’s room for optimization.

If this number increases week-over-week, it could signal:

A warehouse is understaffed

A supply chain issue

Or a spike in order volume not being handled efficiently

This number should be monitored over time and sliced by:

Fulfillment center

Product category

Week or month

Shipping region

✅ Takeaway
Tracking average fulfillment time is a key operational KPI.
It impacts everything from customer satisfaction to logistics planning and inventory flow.
This query provides a baseline that the team can benchmark, optimize, and react to.

Let me know if you’d like to build weekly trends, percentile fulfillment time, or center-specific breakdowns next.
