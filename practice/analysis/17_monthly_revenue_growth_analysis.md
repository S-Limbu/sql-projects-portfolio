# üß™ Query Logic Breakdown

```sql
SELECT 
DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date) AS month,
SUM(amount) AS monthly_revenue,
LAG(SUM(amount)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)) AS previous_month,
ROUND(
    (SUM(amount) - LAG(SUM(amount)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date))) * 100.0
    / LAG(SUM(amount)) OVER (ORDER BY DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)), 2
  ) AS mom_growth_percent
FROM revenue
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date)
ORDER BY month;


What‚Äôs happening and why?

- DATE_TRUNC('month', order_date): Extracts the month from each order_date to group all sales into monthly buckets.

- SUM(amount): Adds up all sales amounts per month, giving us the monthly revenue.

- LAG(SUM(amount)) OVER (...): Retrieves the revenue from the previous month to enable MoM comparisons.

- MoM Growth Calculation:
(Current Month - Previous Month) / Previous Month * 100
This formula returns the percentage change in revenue between months. The use of ROUND(..., 2) ensures the value is clean and presentation-ready.

- ORDER BY month ensures that results appear chronologically for clarity.
