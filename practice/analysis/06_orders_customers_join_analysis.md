## 🧰 SQL Concepts Used

| Concept         | Purpose                                                                 |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `JOIN`          | Combines two related tables (`orders` and `customers`) into one result. |
| `ON` condition  | Specifies how the rows from both tables are matched (`customer_id`).     |
| Aliasing (`o`, `c`) | Improves readability by shortening table names.                    |

## 🧪 Query Logic Breakdown

```sql
SELECT o.id AS order_id, c.name AS customer_name, o.amount
FROM orders o
JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id;


What’s happening and why?

- JOIN merges the orders table with the customers table.

- The ON clause ensures rows are only matched when the customer_id from orders aligns with the id from customers.

- Aliases (o, c) make the query cleaner and easier to read.

📊 Output Summary

| order\_id | customer\_name | amount |
| --------- | -------------- | ------ |
| 101       | Alice          | 200    |
| 102       | Bob            | 300    |
| 103       | Charlie        | 150    |
Each row now contains:

- The order ID,

- The customer name (instead of just a customer ID),

- The order amount.

- This makes the dataset human-readable and client-ready.

🔍 Business Insight

- Rather than sifting through two disconnected tables, this single report gives the Customer Success Team everything they need — fast.

- Enables targeted outreach: If Alice has a high order value, she might be prioritized for follow-up.

- Also supports real-time dashboards that show active orders with named customers.

🔑 Takeaway
JOINs are fundamental to relational databases, and this use case proves just how powerful they are when pulling together people and their data.

This approach not only improves reporting quality but also lays the groundwork for more advanced analytics, like customer lifetime value or cohort-based purchasing behavior.
